@JanelleCShane I once helped @ElanaSchlenker get a data set of strip club names for a potential project. I took that data set, expanded it to a modest 4.5k establishment names from around the world, and asked a neural net to generate new strip club names. https://t.co/BDNztEAUs7

@penrici With print, how one sets type is how it is printed. Not so with screensâ€”you might have a device/browser that doesnâ€™t support typographic features, or a font file that takes a long time to download.
@penrici I havenâ€™t had enough print experience to confidently say! In my experience, though, the biggest â€œruleâ€ changes are to do with predictability (and lack thereof) of screen mediums as compared to paper.
I also feel like Iâ€™ve fostered a distinct writing style and style guide to boot, which Iâ€™m proud of. Brand is writing style as well as visual identity, my friends.
"Iâ€™ve had the same typographic â€œbrandâ€ for a good 2 years now, and it looks to be that way for a while to come.

Neue Haas Unica and Tiempos Text. Iâ€™ve flirted with more â€œBritishâ€ typography, but the pragmatism of this combo keeps me coming back."

@xAbhishek My main critique is more about the process than the medium: that our efforts are needlessly duplicated between Design &amp; Eng, and that the majority of a typical designerâ€™s time is wasted.
Realistically, I think â€œDesign tools that output the finished productâ€ are still ~10-15 years away. Something we can do _today_ is change our processes and make Engineers an explicit part of the Design process.

@adel Mostly looking for something that's either A) even more compact (Leica Q) or B) full frame (both), purely out of curiosity
@adel Full disclosure: I'm looking at new cameras myself, always eyeing Leica Q and Sony A7 series, but the a6k is a real beast
@adel and image quality, long honing process of getting to know the camera and its limits/strengths ðŸ˜Š
@adel You should play with a Fuji if you get a chance! Going from NEX-5 to a6000 was an instant increase in flexibility [...[
@adel At a given time, I only care about a couple of settings. Sony delivers well on satisfying that need.
@adel I've only briefly played with a Fuji camera, but found the UX a /bit/ overwhelming. It gives you a ton of control but I find I don't need it
@adel As a former NEX-5 owner, I say if you have E-mount lenses you like, stick with Sony's cameras. a6XXX get shining reviews for a good reason.
@adel Some sample shots: https://t.co/YAHw25SqQa
@adel That's an expensive lens, but a cheap and excellent lens is the Sigma 19mm Æ’2.8. I take the camera everywhere.
@adel Iâ€™ve invested a lot in lenses, which, as with most cameras, really make or break the experience. Current go-to lens is a Zeiss 24mm Æ’1.8.
@adel I have the a6000, so a couple models behind, but essentially the same. I love the camera for its compactness and speed.

@tealtan Yeah, some sites do this, but I usually have to stick to singing a little numerical rhyme to myself while I switch apps
@tealtan I remember at Dropbox we worked on a feature that required 8-Digit passcodes (43 million combinations!)
@tealtan Thinking of them as two 3-Digit numbers is easier
"@tealtan 9â´ = 6,561 possible combinations

Plot twist: the Burger King is a cow
Once it is built, remember that â€œdesign completeâ€ is a myth.
â€œDesign completeâ€ is a myth. Something is â€œdesign completeâ€ only once it has been built.
@calrgn There is; building the damn thing.
@hrtlym PMs shouldnâ€™t design, but they will, especially when the design team is small. Another reason why design systems are so important!
We need better dev empathy &amp; better understanding of the nature of the medium for which we design. Better tools can help bring those things.
We prod and poke at our ideas in a rigid pixel canvas, and when our ideas donâ€™t come to life in the product, itâ€™s easy to blame the dev.
@_sh4d @jongold Twist: weâ€™re actually just bots built by the same Markov chain.
Our tools must improve. Coding is just one way to avoid that reality.
That said, I refuse the idea that â€œlearn to codeâ€ is THE answer to being a better designer. Thatâ€™s not a fair request.
And *every* publicly-available design tool uses them at their core. This is one reason why code is so attractiveâ€”it forces diff. approaches.
Amongst other things, absolute values of position and size are extremely crude and carry a host of dangerous assumptions.
But at the end of the day, weâ€™re still just overloading our work in a very fragile way. Weâ€™re still a long way from the â€œReactâ€ era.
Our best design tools feel like the advent of the â€œjQueryâ€ age in JSâ€”a step forward and massive improvement, for sure.
Even the most â€œadvancedâ€ digital design tools are based on workflows for drawing mere pictures of interfaces.
Todayâ€™s design tools provide no expression of functionality, state, or relationships, qualities unique to digital design.
Todayâ€™s design tools provide a mere proxy for design intent.

IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO AREN'T LIKE YOU, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY WORK ALONE
"BIG HINT

THE FIRST THING IN THIS LIST IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR THAT WORK-HAPPINESS"
No team is perfect, but every one of us is responsible for encouraging diversity, consistency, and quality to better our work and lives.
Design systems can bring a common language to teams with divergent points of view.
All these things are crucial to one another; objective truth in data is achievable only when a diverse team can circumvent biases.
But fundamentally, I think data satiates our craving for understanding; so long as it is based in objective truth.
Do our analytics indicate poor planning or execution of our design system?
DATA supports these first two thingsâ€”does our research challenge or support the choice of our homogenous team?
For the same reason that it would be a crazy world if every town had their own measurement system, your team should strive for commonality.
Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s scientific literature out there to support these claims, but itâ€™s mostly simple economics.
DESIGN SYSTEMS support consistency, breed empathy, reduce design iterations, make decisions repeatable, and make products predictable.
A team comprised of brand-new people will have great difficulty navigating the political nuances and history of a company/product.
A team comprised of people who have been around â€œforeverâ€ will be blind to their own inefficiencies and assumptions.
Butâ€”and this is often overlookedâ€”it should also be diverse in terms of tenure.
Your team should be diverse across age, gender, race/ethnicity, religion, physical ability, geographic background, and, yes, partisanship.

As I've thought more about print, though, the constraint of low-fidelity and low-complexity has been a useful exercise

More AI with humility and â€œI donâ€™t understand,â€ please. Focus on learning, not inferring.
They seem to do this by inferring what they can from the request and just doing that piece.
I feel like the problem with most AI chat/voice interfaces is that they try to get around the â€œgarbage in, garbage outâ€ computer problem.
Google Assistant, on the other hand, suffers the fate of completely misinterpreting requests. Iâ€™d rather wait than waste time.
If it canâ€™t answer something immediately, it says â€œLet me get back to you!â€ and comes back later with itâ€™s best effort.
I *hugely* enjoy talking to Facebook M and having it fulfill requests, and one reason is that it doesnâ€™t pretend to be doing a good job.
Apple; just let me text Siri for goodness sake.

@SnazzyHam Iâ€™ve been using it recently, but was holding out for WWDC in hope of Photos features. Got the features, just not the platform.
So imagine my frustration when my girlfriend and I add 800+ photos to a shared vacation album, with no way to order them properly.
In shared photo streams, photos are displayed in the order by which they were added, not the order they were taken in.
".@chrislloyd
1. The new memories feature doesn't let you collaborate w/ other people
2. In a shared photo stream, try rearranging something"
Thatâ€™s not a good thing.
Apple seem to have consistently created introspective products for typically social activitiesâ€”namely, photos and music.
Whatâ€™s the point of creating an album on my phone or my Mac if I canâ€™t share it and rearrange it with other people?
Whatâ€™s the point in curating a memory of a vacation with my girlfriend if she canâ€™t contribute her own photos to the album?
New Photos experience on macOS and iOS 10 is nice, but without *really* great sharing features, itâ€™s just gimmicky.

Learning is fun and so is admitting naivety! We're all learning and we're all increasingly, impossibly naive.
I am often wrong. So are they. That's okay.
Efficiency slows creativity. Creativity slows efficiency. Both are necessary for design to succeed.
Everyone who can recognize inefficiency is a designer. Those who can formulate solutions are the practitioners.
Design is objective. Taste is learned. Deviation is scorned, but necessary for progress.
Design is about much more than making things look good.
I didn't go to design school. Here are some things I've learned about design.

The properties of those components are numerous, but constrained to a set of acceptable values (our subatomic components).
Those subatomic components can be combined in thousands of ways to create hundreds of components.
Rather than creating a component and its variants, you simply have a comprehensive list of â€œingredientâ€ subatomic components.
You then create components by composing subatomic components (properties).
(I like to think of this as â€œsubatomicâ€ design)
Systems like Tachyons et al approach this problem by instead documenting and limiting *properties* of components.
Even when the component is documented, documenting effectively often means dozens/hundreds of instances to capture all states/variants.
Those variants sometimes (read: often) go undocumented, leading to duplication when that component/variant is needed (and created) again.
Design Systems break as they scale (either scaling org or scaling product) because new components/variants of a component are introduced.
Hereâ€™s why I think designing systems with tools/frameworks like Tachyons (https://t.co/vgZZeiXQ5m) is a Good Ideaâ„¢

The first example will match a button without .class, but the second will not.
Worth noting that `:not(button), :not(.class)` and `:not(button, .class)` are not equivalent.
However, the :not selector in CSS selectors level 4 will accept multiple selectors as arguments! Safari 9 already supports this.
PSA: CSS(3) :not only accepts single, simple selectors (e.g. :not(button) vs. :not(button, .class, #id))

With a @require directive, you could selectively import partials IF they haven't been imported in the tree already.
E.g. I want buttons from framework X and nothing else from that framework, but I then (currently) have to manually import dependencies.

I'll write about this in some depth as part of the Dropbox CSS refactoring I'm doing ðŸ’¯

"What are Sass mixins useful for?

@robinrendle I knew that, too! The offset thing is blowing my mind, though. Been on my CSS wishlist for years. Turns out itâ€™s been there.
.@brandonkjacoby not quiteâ€”the first is X, the second is offset from X, and the third is Y (you can also provide a fourth Y offset)
Like `80% center` to get it to look like it was 10px from the right or whatever. Obviously failed with flexible elements.
Iâ€™ve known about background-position, of course, but I always thought it was absolute, so Iâ€™d â€œhackâ€ offsets with percentages.

@elyseholladay @Una my fave part of that issue: http://t.co/UGQjnpew6v
@elyseholladay @Una what the actual fuck
@rsms are you suggesting those problems donâ€™t exist with other languages? CSS is brittle, but it can be wrangled with the right approach.
If JS was given the same attitude of CSS, it would probably have taken CSSâ€™s place in that survey.
Funny to consider that something taking time &amp; pain seems to demote it to unworthy of â€œengineeringâ€ status.
(Number 1 was the Dev VM, which often feels like itâ€™s been booting and provisioning for about 8 years)
Running a scrappy survey amongst Dropboxâ€™s web engineers showed writing/dealing with CSS was where they felt 2nd most amount of pain &amp; time.
@ShaneHudson @mdo @damdeez helps that GitHub uses GitHub to build GitHub. #GitHub
@damdeez @mdo would love to see more designers making changes and running CSS, though. Different problem (eng bar is pretty damn high)
@damdeez @mdo at Dropbox very few designers get server access. Fostering tools, vocabulary, and guidelines for devs is our long-term plan.
@MsFionaTay @Una but now we have a thriving team dedicated to front end. Proud to be working with them on fixing Dropbox CSS :)
@MsFionaTay @Una this is all since about ~8 months ago. Prior to that, most of our hiring was exclusively full stack, back end, or JS :(
@MsFionaTay @Una we do! Plenty of CSS/general dev exercises that give us a signal on how they think about front-end architecture.
@MsFionaTay @Una often takes showing those JS devs the problems at scale to pique their interest.

@Heal (something still severely lacking here at Dropbox. Working on it.)
@Heal I really believe this is the single biggest blocker for most EPD teams, and it comes down to well-documented atomic design systems.
@510home @jina but we (Network Growth team) are lucky enough to have @littlenono &amp; @ChelseaRandall sitting right with us!
@510home @jina almost allâ€”the Brand team still operates mostly like-an-agency, because of the nature of their work.
For that reason alone, code is worth understanding. *Really* understand that you can make computers *do cool shit*.
I still remember the thrill of doing something as simple as "cd ~" in terminal. Mainly because it still gives me a kick.
@jina so much fun!
@jina doing so meant I learnt enough to contribute to our production code, and my Engineers learned enough design to run (mostly) alone.
@jina we relatively recently moved from Design-as-an-agency to embedded teams and itâ€™s unlocked so much conversation/learning btw Eng/Design
Engineers: is this thing as fast and simple as it can be? Find out.
Both these parties can learn from the habits of one another. Designers: who will pick up your torch when youâ€™re gone? Help them out.
Tangentially related thing-Iâ€™ve-noticed: (Good) Designers prioritise the users of their product. (Good) Engineers prioritise coworkers.
Successful design fundamentally relies on a strong sense of empathy. Where better to start than with the people realizing your vision?
Also: help your engineers understand design, so that *they* can contribute in meaningful ways and get their own new avenues.
"It generates empathy and unlocks new avenues of thought.

And youâ€™ll feel like a bloody nerd genius."
Understanding code lets you walk the same trenches as the engineers building your shit. It enables otherwise impossible conversations.
Designers: learn to code. Not because you â€œhave toâ€ or because youâ€™d be dumb not to, but because itâ€™ll help your careers. [â€¦]

PSA: El Capitan beta 3 doesnâ€™t play nice with Vagrant/VMWare. Kernel panic raised by vmnet-netifup.
Architecture, best practices, and new tools is all I hear about these daysâ€”but how are brand-new people learning CSS? What do they need?
Talking about that stuff at #SummerHackDay made me realize THATâ€™S the stuff that takes years to really click.
Thinking about setting some time aside to record some screencasts for CSS basicsâ€”box model, cascade, positioning, etc.
You also canâ€™t manipulate artboards with it, and it doesnâ€™t honor cascade (2 height declarations are ignored rather than honoring the last)
Caveats: everything needs an explicit width/height; you can't position something implicitly w/ top/right/bottom/left; no auto margins.
Cool things: you can // comment code; you get freaking flex box support; it works pretty reliably (so long as you follow the rules)

Spent most of the day so far watching styles-in-React/JS videos like this: http://t.co/FZHeApt5nO
Many engineers hate writing CSS at Dropbox (and theyâ€™re not good at it, either). If only for their comfort, separate CSS makes sense here.
It forces thought about DOM structure and style abstractionâ€”things that are often overlooked with React.
I think thereâ€™s an advantage unaccounted for with the attributes of CSS that people â€œhateâ€ (cascade, inheritance, etc.)
Short take on inline styles debate: I definitely see the merit, but donâ€™t trust engineers without deep knowledge of CSS to write them well.

At Dropbox, as we move more stuff onto React, weâ€™re veering towards decoupled JS and CSS, with React modules that make HTTP reqs for CSS.

@ChaseGiunta youâ€™re right. But should that mean we donâ€™t try? ANYTHING we do would help reduce the number of people who die at gunpoint.

Newsflash: White Men Are Terrible. We have more power than any other race or gender. Relinquish or use it for good. Be mindful of it.
Donâ€™t feel attacked (or rather, donâ€™t defend yourself) when someone calls out your privilege. Itâ€™s there. Try using it for good.
Surround yourself with people who can smell &amp; call bullshit. Amplify them.
I canâ€™t begin to imagine the difficulty of succeeding w/o my privilege. Many of us are at a significant advantage from day 1â€”remember that.
Itâ€™s exhausting. And the fact itâ€™s exhausting to meâ€”a privileged young, white, cis maleâ€”is deeply troubling.

RT @typodactyl: @_dte Bingo. Here's a pretty interesting comic about one person's dealing with it: http://t.co/2M0gNFaYpk
@amosie oh my god yes. Iâ€™ve wanted that for a long time.
RT @typodactyl: @_dte Also to your point, while ignorance exists, more ppl in the U.S. fighting it. Here's a great article: http://t.co/5fTâ€¦
RT @typodactyl: @_dte In general, I think mental illness is treated badly everywhere. There's just different flavors of the discrimination.
RT @typodactyl: @_dte Though in the U.S., "get better" is usually like "will away your sadness!" akin to telling amputees to grow limbs. :\
@typodactyl of course, globally thereâ€™s still sooo much misinformed perception, but interesting to note attitudinal differences from nations
@typodactyl :) Iâ€™ve had many people very close to me suffer from depression or other mental illness (mostly back in the UK). Happy to talk!
@typodactyl thatâ€™s not what Iâ€™ve seen/experiencedâ€”therapy and medication is way more accessible and less taboo here.
"In the UK, depressed people are often deemed either irreparably unwell or â€œjust sad.â€

In the US, those people are encouraged to get better."
It is *such* a drastic issue, and it means that those that need the most help canâ€™t get it or are shamed out of it.
"England has a dangerously misinformed perception of mental illness, perpetuated by the media.

@DesignUXUI nope, I heard it on a film (canâ€™t remember what film now) and *had* to listen to it again.
@lalalalinna I actually use iA Writer (Pro) for this. You can shrink it down pretty small.
One thing I would LOVE to see browser vendors add: â€œCopy link to this sectionâ€ for elements with ID attributes in the contextual menu.
@helenvholmes daneden! :)
Product/catalogue updates will yield new customers (and more $), but poor stability will burn a hole in your revenue way faster.
With a service like that, design/product/catalogue updates should be much, much lower priority than infra and foundation stability.

@leaverou the same holds true even for JS-powered prototyping tools like Framer.

@carolynz nope, because I have that color in my siteâ€™s header.html :(

@carolynz e.g. Iâ€™d love to replace the hex codes here https://t.co/MIUud9QtRO and here https://t.co/dMc8rJ1Ehx with site.color or something.
@carolynz I want to set a site-wide variable for a color to use in both Sass and HTML (https://t.co/MIUud9QtRO)
I asked this to no avail some time ago: anyone know if it's possible to access a Jekyll/Liquid variable in Sass?

@lachlanjc ugh, Handoff. It seems to only want to show up when Iâ€™m on Netflix (the least useful time for it.)
@lachlanjc more often though, I want to open a tab thatâ€™s open on another device.
@lachlanjc sometimes useful. Plenty of times I forget I already have a tab for the site Iâ€™m after.
@lachlanjc ack. Yeah, â€œall tabsâ€ is what I meant for iOS 8. I guess what I really want is for â€œall tabsâ€ to be the new tab page on OS X.
Not sure I understand why the â€œnew tabâ€ view on iOS Safari shows iCloud tabs, but on OS X Safari, it doesnâ€™t. Stick it on the wish list.

@kristyt itâ€™s those gaps that are most telling of a personâ€™s true story. Theyâ€™re often the darkest and the brightest.
@kristyt people do or have the option to fill in the gaps between the tweets, pictures, videos, and blog posts that someone publishes.
